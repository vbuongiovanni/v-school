*** Custom Components Quiz:

1. What is a React component?
A React component is a JS function that uses JSX to return React Elements (writes HTML elements to the DOM). 

2. What's wrong with this code?

The name of the function isn't written in PascalCase. It should be MyComponent() rather than myComponent().
Additionally, the code doesn't actually add anything to the DOM. In order for the code to be rendered,
we would also need to include 'ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />, document.getElementById("root"));'
Also... we would need to import React and ReactDOM modules.
```
function myComponent() {
    return (
        <small>I'm tiny text!</small>
    )
}
```

3. What's wrong with this code?

The syntax to call the Header() function is incorrect - it should be '<Header />' instead of 'Header()'
```
function Header() {
    return (
        <header>
            <nav>
                <img src="./react-logo.png" width="40px" />
            </nav>
        </header>
    )
}

ReactDOM.render(Header(), document.getElementById("root"))
```
