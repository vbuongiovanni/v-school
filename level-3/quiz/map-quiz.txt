1. What does the `.map()` array method do?

Given an array, .map() will 'map' the contents to a given callback function... Basically, you can apply a function to all elements in the array, which will then be returned in a new array.


2. What do we usually use `.map()` for in React?

Map existing raw data, typically objects, into JSX elements.


3. Why is using `.map()` better than just creating the components
   manually by typing them out?

More maintainable, reusable, and concise. Scalable more DRY
