1. How would you describe the concept of "state"?
A state is effectively a local variable within a component that is mutable.
Contrary to props, states are dynamic and will be change in order to appropriately implement the desired functionality


2. When would you want to use props instead of state?
If the value is static and does not need to be changed by the component itself. Props should be used like parameters in a function - when you need to pass values into a component.

3. When would you want to use state instead of props?
If the value is dynamic and DOES need to be changed by the component itself. Props should be used like local variables within a function. 
States are needed when a component needs to maintain or remember values irrespective of render cycles.

4. What does "immutable" mean? Are props immutable? Is state immutable?
Mutability refers to whether or not the value can be changed. Props are immutable, while state is mutable.
