1. In a vanilla JS app, at what point in the form submission
   process do you gather all the data from the filled-out form?
At the time of submissions (e.g., when user hits submit through <button></button> or <input type="button"/>).

2. In a React app, when do you gather all the data from
   the filled-out form?
If using state/controlled components, all inputs are gathered everytime there is a change. E.g., as the form is being filled out
This is because react carries each field's state rather than delegating it to the html elements.

3. Which attribute in the form elements (value, name, onChange, etc.)
   should match the property name being held in state for that input?
'name' should match property name to facilitate the calculated naming of properties within the formData object(s).

4. What's different about saving the data from a checkbox element
   vs. other form elements?
The checkbox element doesn't use a 'value' property to store it's content. Instead, it uses 'checked' which is a boolean representation of whether or not the element is checked.

5. How do you watch for a form submit? How can you trigger
   a form submit?
You can watch for a submit event by using the 'onSubmit' handler on the <form></form> element. Usually with a button click - this will work by default using the <button></button> element.
