1. What is a "side effect" in React? What are some examples?
    
    In short, it is any code that React isn't able to handle. 
    More specifically, q side effect is anything that causes lasting impacts on a React app / DOM. Essentially this happens when something outside React changes something within React (changes to State)
    Examples include manual mutation of the DOM after initial render, calls to an external database, calls to an external API, sockets, two separate  that etc.

2. What is NOT a "side effect" in React? Examples?
    Anything that React IS in charge of..For example - changes in state from within React, render DOM, etc.. An input field changing a State?

3. When does React run your useEffect function? When does it NOT run
   the effect function?
   
   useEffect() takes a callback function and dependency array. useEffect() runs after the initial render and after every rerender. 
   However, the callback function will only execute if the dependency array has any false values. If the array was empty, the callback function will not be reran. 
   If the array contains all true values (values of variables within the dependency array are equal to their values on the last run), then the callback function will not be reran.
   
4. How would you explain what the "dependencies array" is?
    
    It is the second parameter to the useEffect function and tells useEffect whether or not the callback function should be reran.
    its an array of variables that will be compared by useEffect() prior to the execution of the callback Function.
    If the current value of any of the variables are not equal to the value from the last time useEffect() was called, then useEffect() will be executed.
