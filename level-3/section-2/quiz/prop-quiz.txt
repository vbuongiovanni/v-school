1. What do props help us accomplish?
Create reusable code through parameterized components.


2. How do you pass a prop into a component?
By adding properties to the function call in the JSX code. E.g.:
"<Component propertyToPassOne="something here" propertyToPassTwo="something else here"/>

3. Can I pass a custom prop (e.g. `blahblahblah={true}`) to a native
   DOM element? (e.g. <div blahblahblah={true}>) Why or why not?
No. Native DOM is, effectively, the same as standard HTML. Since standard HTML only understands predefined properties, this will not work.


4. How do I receive props in a component?
function Navbar() {
    return (
        <header>
            ...
        </header>
    )
}
By adding a parameter to the function. The first argument will then be an object that stores all properties.
Note that you can name this parameter whatever you want, but by convention it should be named 'props'


5. What data type is `props` when the component receives it?

its an Object.
