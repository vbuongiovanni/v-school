                    <h2>What We Do</h2>
                    <p>With such a generic company name, people often ask us - "what exactly do you guys do?". 
                        Well, simply put - we solve problems. Need help building a website? 
                        No problem. Have an idea for a web application, but you have no idea where to start? Hit us up. Termite infestation? 
                        We got you, though we might end up outsourcing to someone who deals with the little buggers on a more regular basis. The fact is, our specialty is making problems disappear. 
                        And to be clear, before you notify the authorities, we don't mean making people disappear like the movies... All our services comply with state and federal laws.
                    
                    </p>
