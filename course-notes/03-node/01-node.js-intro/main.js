console.log("Hello World!");


// in a nutshell, node.js allows JS to run the terminal enviroment.
// this file can be ran by running 'node.js path/to/file/main.js'
// node does not access the DOM directly like a src=*.js script does, because node is not attached directly to the HTML
// With that, there are specific elements that are unique to node (e.g., 'module')
// Node is built, with existing APIs, to perform many tasks that will be inherently required to create a web server, including:
    // better ways to organize code in reusable pieces
    // ways to deal with files
    // ways to deal with databases
    // ability to communicate over the internet
    // ability to accept requests and send responses (in a consistent and standard way)
    // way to deal with work that takes a long time (server side processing)
