SQL to MongoDB terminology Key:

    In a nutshell, SQL uses Tables of Records that are uniquely identified via Primary Key.
    In Contrast, MongoDB uses Collections of Documents that are uniquely identified via id's


    Table/Relation      |       Collections (think JS array)
    Records             |       Documents (think JS Object)
    Primary Key         |       _id

    Note that the 3 types of relationships of SQL translate over to SQL in the same manner...

    - 1 to 1
    - 1 to M
    - M to M

    Collections are defined using 'models', which provide a blueprint. Example:

    User {
        name : String,
        age : Age,
        _id : asdfaskdjfhhbasdjk
    }




** One Huge Difference Between SQL & MongoDB **

    By default, MongoDB is similar to SQLLite in that it is the wild-west in terms of data enforcement... It just doesn't.

    Therefore, we will use:
        - MongoDB stores the data.
        - Mongoose to enforce rigidity. Additionally, it creates models and facilitates the data query process.
