// JavaScript Arrays
// Complex data type, zero indexed
// Also known as lists. 
// Prebuilt properties: length

var myNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

var colors = ["blue", "green", "red", "yellow", "purple"]

// returns green
console.log(myNumbers[1])

// every array comes with a property 'length' which shows the number of items.

// this would return 5
console.log( myNumbers.length )


// Note on Strings:
    // Strings are treated as an array with respect to length an indexing:
var name = "joe"
console.log( name[0] )
